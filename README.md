XcodeBoost
==========

An Xcode plugin that makes altering and inspecting Objective-C code quick and easy.

XcodeBoost automates some tedious operations such as **extracting method declarations from definitions** for insertion into a header file, adds **line-based manipulation** (cut/copy/paste/duplicate/delete lines), **persistent highlighting** and more!

*Contributions are welcome! :)*
